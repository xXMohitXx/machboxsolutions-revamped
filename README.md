This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Machboxtry

This project is a Next.js website scaffolded with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and src directory. It is set up to use reactbits.dev, shadcn/ui, and GSAP for modern UI and animation capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. Run the development server:
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Libraries Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [reactbits.dev](https://reactbits.dev/)

## Notes

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
